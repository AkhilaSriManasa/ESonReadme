The folder "ResultsESonReadme.zip" presents the results of the study - "Is there a correlation between Readme Content and Project
meta-characteristics?"
The study aims to analyse the impact of presence of structural components (features) and contextual types (categories) in readme
files of the repositories on meta-characteristics of repositories.

The folder contains two sub-folders - Features and Categories, each containing data and results of analysis of the three project meta-characteristics - 
rate of progress, community size and popularity in three sub folders - "Progress", "Community" and "Popularity" respectively. 

Each of these three folders contain "Results" folder with the results of statistical analysis.
The data files corresponding to each language are presented as "Res_language.csv" in each of the sub folders.

For data files ("Res_language.csv") in Categories folder - The categories are indicated as 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, referring to "what", "why", "how", "when", "who", "reference", "contribution guidelines", respectively. The number 8 indicates, presence of content that does not belong to any of the seven categories mentioned above.

For data files ("Res_language.csv") in Features folder - The feature counts in readme files are stored in the corresponding feature columns - "List","Image","Animation","Video","Table","Github","Links","Project","Inline","Code".


Replicating the Statistical Tests and Results:
Each of the project meta-characteristics folders contain a run.py for both Categories and Features, which executes the corresponding statistical tests in the order below on each of the programming languages, and can be executed as "python3 run.py":
(I) For Categories:
(i) Fisher's exact test
(ii) Spearman's Co-efficient and Correlation analysis
(iii) Random Forest Classifier - for calculating gini and permutation based importance scores 

(II) For Features:
(i) Wilcoxon's rank-sum test
(ii) Cliff's delta test
(iii) Spearman's Co-efficient and Correlation analysis
(iv) Random Forest Classifier - for calculating gini and permutation based importance scores 

The summaries of these analyses can be generated by running "python3 summarize_res_fishers.py", "python3 summarize_res_rfc.py" for categories and 
"python3 summarize_res_wilcoxon.py", "python3 summarize_res_cliffs.py" and "python3 summarize_res_rfc.py" for features.
      
The Results of these statistical analysis are stored in the corresponding "Results" folders.

The "Results" folder under project meta-characteristic folders of "Categories" consists of the results of applying statistical methods on the data.
	1.1 The results of applying fisher's exact test on repositories in each programming language are presented as "FishersResults_language.csv"
	These files present the p-value of Fisher's exact test, with categories indicated as 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, referring to "what", "why", "how", "when", "who", "reference", "contribution guidelines", respectively.

	1.2 The "Corr_Categories_language.csv" files for each of the programming languages presents the correlated categories for the specific programming language, along with the correlation factor value.
The "Categories_Spearman_language.csv" files for each of the programming languages presents the spearman's correlation values for every pair of categories.	
The categories are indicated as C1,C2,C3,C4,C5,C6,C7, referring to "what", "why", "how", "when", "who", "reference", "contribution guidelines", respectively.
	
	1.3 The "RFC.csv" and "RFC_PERM.csv" files indicate the gini and permutation based importance scores respectively, of each category for each programming language, along with the average accuracy score of Random Forest Classifier constructed on which gini and permutation based importance methods are applied.
The categories are indicated as C1,C2,C3,C4,C5,C6,C7, referring to "what", "why", "how", "when", "who", "reference", "contribution guidelines", 
	respectively.
	
	1.4 The "Fishers_Summary.csv" file presents a summary of p-value ranges across all programming languages.
	1.5 The "RFC_Summary.csv" file presents a summary of gini-importance scores across all programming languages.
	1.6 The "RFC_PERM_Summary.csv" file presents a summary of permutation-based-importance scores across all programming languages.


The "Results" folder under project meta-characteristic folders of "Features" consists of the results of applying statistical methods on the data.

	2.1 The results of applying wilcoxon's rank-sum test on repositories in each programming language are presented as "WilcoxonResults_language.csv" files, and present the p-values of wilcoxon's rank sum test for each of the features.
      2.2 The results of applying Cliff's Delta Test on repositories in each programming language are presented as "CliffsResults_language.csv" files, and present the delta values, followed by the extent of impact as large, medium, small and negligible for each of the features.
		
	2.3 The "RFC.csv" and "RFC_PERM.csv" files indicate the gini and permutation based importance scores respectively, of each feature for each programming language, along with the average accuracy score of Random Forest Classifier constructed on which gini and permutation based importance methods are applied.
	
	2.4 The "Fishers_Summary.csv" file presents a summary of p-value ranges across all programming languages.
	2.5 The "RFC_Summary.csv" file presents a summary of gini-importance scores across all programming languages.
	2.6 The "RFC_PERM_Summary.csv" file presents a summary of permutation-based-importance scores across all programming languages.

The raw distribution (without any statistical analysis) of each of the features and categories across each programming language are presented in "Feature_Distribution" and "Category_distribution" folders as "meta-characteristic_score_Feature/Category_Language.png" (ex: progress_score_List_Ruby.png, progress_score_C1_Ruby.png)
